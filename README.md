# Quiz App

A simple quiz application built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap 5(CLI)**. This app allows users to register, log in, play quizzes created by other users, and manage their own quizzes. The application stores all data in the **browser's local storage**.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can register and log in to access the application.
- **Play Quizzes**: Users can play quizzes created by others and earn points if all answers are correct.
- **Profile Management**: Users can view their total points, profile details, recently played quizzes, and quizzes they have created.
- **Quiz Creation & Management**: Users can create quizzes, add questions, delete quizzes, and edit existing ones.
- **Data Persistence**: All user data and quiz details are stored in the browser's local storage.
- **User Restriction**: Users cannot play their own quizzes.

## How It Works

1. **Register & Login**: Users sign up and log in to access the app.
2. **Create a Quiz**: Users can create a quiz by specifying the quiz name, difficulty level, and adding questions.
3. **Play Quizzes**: Users can attempt quizzes created by others.
4. **Earn Points**: If a user answers all questions correctly, quiz points are added to their profile.
5. **Manage Quizzes**: Users can view, edit, and delete quizzes they have created.
